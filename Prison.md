The easy way would be to make it the same as the walk in town and the other girl finding in the other buildings.

Another way would be similar to how the slave market works.

You need to bribe the guards to get into the holding cells, that price could vary with disposition, suspicion, and bribery rate.

Then you need to pay the girl's bail, that could be any amount, usually multiples of 100, 500 or 1000.

You need to keep the girl out of trouble until her court date, then send them to the court house for her trial.
If you made her better;
  * sent her to rehab,
  * broke her of a certain trait,
  * increased a certain skill or stat,
  * got her famous enough to win by fame,
  * or just bribed the judge
You can keep her.

If you fail to get her to the court on time, if she runs away or dies, you loose something or have to pay more fines.

If she hates you she will turn on you in court and you will have a really bad time for a while.
